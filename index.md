# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to this ancpBIDS documentation.

**ancpBIDS** is a lightweight Python library to handle BIDS datasets efficiently. 
* Read, query and writes BIDS-compliant datasets.
* Managing I/O operations within wokflows and analysis pipelines. Such as [MEGqc](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/MEGqc).
* Its functionality adapts and evolves to the specific BIDS schema.
* Using a plugin mechanism, users can add new functionalities in a controlled and clean manner.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn more about ancpBIDS.
- Learn how to use ancpBIDS to query, read and write BIDS datasets.
- Learn how to tntegrate ancpBIDS within your pipeline.

## Requirements for this tutorial
- A working version of Python3
- Some familiarity with MEG or MRI data
- Some familiarity with GitHub
